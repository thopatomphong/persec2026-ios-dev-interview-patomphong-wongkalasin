iOS Developer Interview Project - Persec 2026
This repository contains my technical assessment for the iOS Developer position at Persec. The project demonstrates my proficiency in Swift, SwiftUI, architectural patterns, and best practices in modern iOS development.

📱 Project Overview

This mobile application serves as a technical showcase of core programming logic and algorithmic problem-solving. It features a suite of utility tools ranging from string manipulation and mathematical sequences to data sorting and numeral conversion. Each feature is implemented with a focus on time complexity optimization, edge-case handling, and a clean, responsive User Interface.

🚀 Features

1: Bracket Validator

2: String Array Sort

3: Auto Complete

4: Roman Number Converter

5: Sort Numbers

6: Tribonacci

🏗 Architecture & Design Patterns

Architecture: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) / Clean Architecture

UI Framework: SwiftUI

Functional Reactive Programming:  Combine

Why this architecture?

I chose MVVM because it ensures a clear separation of concerns, making the codebase highly testable and maintainable. This approach facilitates independent development of UI and business logic.
